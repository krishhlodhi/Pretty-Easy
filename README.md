This Linux package enhances the command line by making your terminal more visually appealing and user-friendly. It formats common Linux command outputs into clean tables and lightweight GUI-style elements, transforming plain text into a more easily readable format. The goal is to improve the command-line experience without changing the functionality of the underlying tools, maintaining all the power of the CLI while providing a more polished presentation.
